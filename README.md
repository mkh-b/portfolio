# My Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! This is where I document a summary of my projects in the data field.

## Project 1: Salary Distribution Analysis

**Dataset source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data

**Dataset information:** it contains 6 columns, each column representing a variable: Gender, Age, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience, Salary. 
The "Gender" variable presents two classes: "Male" and "Female", the age of the individuals in the dataset varies from 21 until 62, while education is represented in the form of four levels: High School, Bachelor's Degree, Master's Degree and PhD. The dataset also contains a total 183 different job positions, and the number of years each employee has as experience varying from 0 to 34 years. The unit of the variable "Salary" is INR (Indian Rupee).

**Objectives of the analysis:**
- Analyze the salary distribution across different job titles and education levels.
- Determine the average salary for each category.
- Investigate if there is a significant gender pay gap.
- Study the influence of the years of experience on the salary levels.
- Study the impact of the education level and how it affects salary levels.
- Identify the highest paid employees of the dataset, by Age, Years of Experience and Job Title.

# Project 2: Data-Driven Strategy for Content: Case Study

## Introduction: 
In this digital age we live in, social media has become a vital part of our lives. Platforms that were once seen as online spaces for socializing are now utilized for matters of business, dating, politics, and daily communication. These platforms remain the top choice for individuals to grow their businesses and brands 
through advertisements and marketing strategies.
Reaching your target audience and bringing new customers on social media isn't always a success, and can be especially challenging for small, medium and newly opened online businesses that don't have already existing popularity on social platforms, which is where Data Science and Data Analysis come in.
Whether you own a business or you simply aim to grow your platform and its online presence by increasing user engagement and audience reach, you will need a data-driven content strategy to optimize the platformâ€™s engagement and audience growth.
This project is a case study created by Aman Kharwal, posted on statso.io (https://statso.io/data-driven-strategy-for-content-case-study/)
